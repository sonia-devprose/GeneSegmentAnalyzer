# GeneSegmentAnalyzer

This program is designed to gather information about a gene segment in a DNA sequence. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Input the length of the gene segment**: The program asks the user to enter the length of a specific gene segment (e.g., how many nucleotides it contains).
   
2. **Input the count of gene segments**: The program prompts the user to enter how many such gene segments are present in the entire DNA sequence.

3. **Input the name of the gene segment**: The program asks the user for the name of the gene segment (e.g., a specific gene name like "BRCA1").

4. **Display the results**: Finally, the program prints a summary of the information entered. It shows the name of the gene segment, how many segments are present, and the length of the segment.

Overall, the program collects some basic attributes of a gene segment (name, count, and length) and outputs them in a formatted way. This type of program could be useful in gene biotech, where researchers deal with specific gene sequences and their attributes.
